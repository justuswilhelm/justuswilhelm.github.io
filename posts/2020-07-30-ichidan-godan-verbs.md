title: Japanese conjugation, from two perspectives
---

Language learners and native speakers learn about a language in different ways.
I want to take some time to explain this a little bit further by observing how
Japanese as a foreign language (JFL) learners and Japanese as a native language
(JNL) speakers learn about Japanese grammar.

# The trouble with conjugation

One thing that troubles many language learners is verb conjugation. In verb
conjugation, one observers how a given verb in its dictionary form changes its
form depending on the meaning that a speaker is trying to convey. In some
languages this becomes quite complex.

For example, English has the famous dream/dreamed/dreamt etc. triples, that
make absolutely no sense at all and are _incredibly_ irregular. And even if you
happen to be vaguely aware of each verb's individual etymoligical origins, you
still haven't made any progress.
It is important to know whether a verb has purely Proto-Germanic roots, or
if it is Latin, _when_ exactly it came to the English language. There were at
least four different times in the last 1,500 years when this has happened.

The reality of conjugation is always nasty.

German, with its often projected upon philosophical systematism isn't any
better. Yes, once you know sehen/sah/gesehen, you're closer to the goal, but
now you need to know singular and plural, and third person plural, and then in
passive, and Konjunktiv II, and so on.

And many more languages have their complicated edge cases and irregular
conjugations, so there is a lot of _fun_ to be had conjugating verbs.

I've noticed something interesting about how JFL learners learn verb
conjugation, and how JNL speakers experience their own language, or how JNL
speaker's native resources teach them about their own language.

# Japanese Conjugation Classes

Japanese like many other languages possesses the concept of so called __verb
classes__. In Japanese grammar parlance, these are called N-dan, with N, the
class number, ranging from 1 to 5. And since we are counting in Japanese, we
would say Ichidan, Nidan, Sandan, Yodan and Godan. To know why exactly there
are 5 possible verb classes, the systematization of syllables and their vowels
gives us an answer. The so called
[Gojūon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goj%C5%ABon) table has exactly five rows
(five dan), when read from top down, and produces all possible Japanese kana.
The five rows correspond to each vowel used in Modern Japanese, namely __a__,
__i__, __u__, __e__ and __o__. N-dan then will simply indicate, how many of
those vowels will be used in the course of conjugating a specific verb. But
more on that later.

|Other |W-     |R-     |Y-     |M-     |H-     |N-     |T-      |S-      |K-     |$$\emptyset$$|Vowel|
| :--- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- | :----- | :----- | :---- | :---------- | :-- |
|ん (n)|わ (wa)|ら (ra)|や (ya)|ま (ma)|は (ha)|な (na)|た (ta) |さ (sa) |か (ka)|あ (a)       |a    |
|      |ゐ (wi)|り (ri)|       |み (mi)|ひ (hi)|に (ni)|ち (chi)|し (shi)|き (ki)|い (i)       |i    |

# How I learned Japanese Conjugation

So both JFL learners, as well as JNL speakers learn about this systematism one
way or another. For JFL, it's one of the countless grammar books on Modern
Japanese, and for JNL speakers it's their Kokugo class in school, in which Old
Japanese is covered. So already, we have a hunch that those two target
audiences might be received different information.

And I, a _diligent_ student of Japanese grammar, tried my best to
memorize my _dans_. And the way it was taught to me, is that there are
__exactly__ two verb classes. 一段 (ichidan) and 五段 (godan) conjugation.

Because all I ever learn about as a JFL learner is "Japanese has ichidan and
godan verbs". And ichidan verbs are all those, that end on a "ru", and godan
are those that do not. Let's, for a second, ignore the fact that some godan
verbs end on a る but are conjucated like ichidan verbs.

Sometimes, ichidan verbs are also called __consonant-stem__ verbs, and godan
verbs are called __vowel-stem__ verbs. There is no limit how creatively
teachers seem to name Japanese verb conjugation, and in the wild, one might
also encounter group I/II verbs (though more on that in the appendix). Either
way you call it, it's very much binary, either _a_ or _b_.

I want to illustrate the difference in conjugation between the two classes by
providing a conjugation table for two simple verbs, 食べる (taberu, to eat) and
書く (kaku, to write), ichidan and godan respectively. We conjugate without
looking at the meaning of each individual form in the Japanese language,
therefore only observing syntax, not semantics.

|             | 食べる (taberu) | 書く (kaku)               | Godan Vowel |
| :---------- | :-------------- | :------------------------ | :---------- |
| Irrealis    | 食べ (tabe)     | 書か (kake) / 書こ (kako) | あ / お     |
| Adverbial   | 食べ (tabe)     | 書き (kaki) / 書い (kai)  | い          |
| Conclusive  | 食べ (tabe)     | 書く (kaku)               | う          |
| Attributive | 食べ (tabe)     | 書け (kaku)               | え          |
| Conditional | 食べ (tabe)     | 書け (kake)               | え          |
| Imperative  | 食べ (tabe)     | 書こ (kake)               | え          |
: Conjugation of 食べる (taberu) and 書く (kaku)

Ichidan verb conjugation is extremely straightforward.

1. Identify the stem of the verb: 食べる(taberu) -> 食べ(tabe)
2. Depending on the desired form (negative, infinitive, etc.), append the
   corresponding particle ending. For example, in order to make the ます (masu) form,
   Simply append ます and you have 食べます.

You will see that the stem of taberu -- tabe -- is never touched. It stays the
same for all forms. That's why it's called ichidan. Simple enough, and easy to
learn. Let's look at godan verbs now and describe their conjugation:

1. Identify the stem of the verb: 書く (kaku) -> kak.
2. Depending on the desired form (irrealis, adverbial, etc.), append the
   correspond combination of consonant the stem ends on and godan vowel
   required for this form (refer to table). For example, irrealis would become
   書け.
3. Now append, any necessary particle endings. For example, to receive the ます
   (masu) form, take the adverbial form 書き and append ます.

You already saw me get into trouble when spelling out the stem of 書く and just
writing "kak.". There is not kana representation of consonant stems, and the
only thing one could write is か行, which means ka row of the gojūon table. It
is interesting when everyone can clearly hear the sound for "k", but does not
have the means to note it down except for referring to it by the corresponding
row in the gojūon table.

The cool thing you can take away from this article if you want to impress
someone at the Hub (no disrespect to ALTs tolerated here), and are taking the
(at the time of writing) necessary Covid-19 precautions, you can point out
something really cool:

It's called godan because it uses all five dan from the gojūon. And can you
believe that I passed the JLPT N1 (humbebrag) without knowing this at all? As a
matter of fact, the impetus for me writing this article was that I was caught
red-handed stammering about ichidan and godan conjugation and not having any
clue of what I was talking about.

So one more time, when we look at the kana that start with a k-, or か行, we
see five: か, き, く, け, こ (ka, ki, ku, ke, ko). And when we look at all the
forms of 書く (kaku), we see that all five happy little kanas are in the house
supporting us in the journey of writing this article.

On our way to passing JLPT N five to one in one fell swoop!

# The thing with language education

How do JNL speakers experience their own language? You can gather some first
hand data by asking about ichidan and godan conjugation, and in many cases
not getting a satisfactory answer. Do not assume ignorance here. Knowing
_about_ a language, and _knowing_ a language are two differents things. Once
you master your dans, you won't catch yourself thinking about how to conjugate
this or that verb while you're having a pleasant conversion with someone.

I do not believe that the goal of language education is to _speak like a native
speaker_. First of all, the goal itself by definition is hard to attain or
unattainable. Language is diverse, and language is alive. What might sound
native in one part, sounds foreign in another part, and Japanese despite what
some might think, has a lot of diversity across this long, vaguely banana (not
really tho) shaped country.

The history of the Japanese language dates back quite a while, possible more
than [2000 years](https://www.nytimes.com/2011/05/04/science/04language.html).
For a language to be trapped on the same island for a long time makes it easy
for some individuals to believe or portray that this particular language moves
in a linear fashion. Japanese is described with there being such as things as
"Old Japanese", "Middle Japanese", and "Modern Japanese". What is called Modern
Japanese right now could move into so many directions, and if you are learning
Japanese as a foreign language you are part of the future direction.

And my message to you is, no matter what language you want to master, achieve
fluency and proficiency, and then spice it up with who you are! If you bring
some English accent into your pronunciation, wear it with pride, because it
makes you you. Total language assimilation is for the Borg (TM) and other
cybernetic organisms. Ignore all those superfluous whispers about this or that
person and their accent or their mannerisms. Not to mention that in my humble
experience this is mostly coming from monolingual persons.

# How Conjugation is taught in Japan

Let's get to another concept though that I would really like to mention here.
Because for a long time I just assumed that Japanese would be largely
uneducated about Japanese grammar, kind of like I always nod along when my
German speaking friends speak about Konjunktiv II and how it's used when and I
have no idea what all that means. Yes, I profess my ignorance.

If we just leave it at that, we are missing out on the good stuff though. So
gather along, grammar enthusiasts, and witness the glory of Middle Japanese
grammar, the grammar mommy and daddy of Modern Japanese.

Middle Japanese grammar is a completely different beast, and while you can
clearly see how Middle and Modern Japanese are related, it requires significant
effort to really understand it. It turns out that many ENL speakers learn about
their own language in the context of a school subject called 国語 (kokugo).
Kokugo involves deciphering old Japanese texts that were written more than 500
years ago, and understanding where the language comes from.

On the one hand, not many schools in other parts of the world teach their
students much about, let's say Old German, or Old Norse. But on the other hand
I was taught Latin and Greek in secondary school. The idea there being the
same: Knowing about the languages that gave birth to thoughts and ideas that
are the foundation of what you are speaking right now, will further your
understanding of your place in the world, and also of Grammar.

So far I've not come along many Japanese that longingly look back at their days
of studying kokugo, but most certainly everyone recalls having to memorize verb
conjugation.

As the subject we pick [Late Middle
Japanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_Middle_Japanese) (LMJ). LMJ was
spoken roughly from the 12th century to the 16th century. The beginning of LMJ
is marked by the end of the aristrocratic Heian period and it ends around the
time Portuguese missionaries made their way to Japan and started describing
grammar and and phonology. This is also the point where パン (pan) made its way
into Japanese.

Famous texts written in LMJ include:

- [平家物語](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tale_of_the_Heike) (Heike
  monogatari) -- The Tale of the Heike
- [太平記](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiheiki) (Taiheiki)
- [御伽草子](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otogi-z%C5%8Dshi) (Otogi-Zōshi)

We will now dive into LMJ conjugation and look at some examples.

Remember how modern Japanese is taught as having two classes of conjugation:
Ichidan and godan? We will start by listing all 9 classes of conjugation in
LMJ:

- 四段 (yodan), also called __quadrigrade__
- 上一段 (kamiichidan), also called __upper monograde__
- 上二段 (kaminidan), also called __upper bigrade__
- 下一段 (shimoichidan), also called __lower monograde__
- 下二段 (shimonidan), also called __lower bigrade__
- カ行変格活用 (kagyōhenkakukatsuyō), also called __k-irregular__
- サ行変格活用 (sagyōhenkakukatsuyō), also called __s-irregular__
- ナ行変格活用 (nagyōhenkakukatsuyō), also called __n-irregular__
- ラ行変格活用 (ragyōhenkakukatsuyō), also called __r-irregular__

To gain a better understanding, we will first take a look at the superficial
differences between what we've learned so far on Modern Japanese conjugation
and LMJ conjugation.

You will notice that in the first five classes, we are using 一段 (ichidan),
二段 (nidan) and 四段 (yodan), from which we can deduce that the first five
conjugation classes use either _one_, _two_ or _four_ classes from the gojūon.

Furthermore, we notice the introduction of a 上 (kami) or 下 (shimo), meaning
upper and lower respectively. In principle, upper in this context describes a
conjugation class that uses い (i) paired with a set amount of other vowels. In
turn, lower describes a conjugation class that uses え (e) paired with a set of
other vowels. Upper equals I, lower equals e. Easy.

Then, LMJ conjugation has four irregular conjugation classes, that are each
named after a consonant: k, s, n and r. These conjugation classes contain words
such as

- 来る (kuru), "to come" is __k-irregular__
- 為 (su), "to do" is __s-irregular__
- 愛す (aisu), "to love" is __s-irregular__
- 死ぬ (shinu), "to die" is __n-irregular__
- 往ぬ (inu), "to go home" is __n-irregular__
- あり (ari), "to be" is __r-irregular__
- 侍り (haberi), "to serve" is __r-irregular__

Modern Japanese verbs has less irregular conjugation, but these verbs are still
around in some form or another. 来る (kuru) and 死ぬ (shinu), for example,
continue existing as they are, with their conjugation being mostly the same (as
will be shown below). Others have been turned into _suru_ verbs, such
as 愛す (aisu) and 為 (su). These are nowadays expressed as 愛する (aisuru) and
為る (suru), with the latter usually being written with kana alone, so simply
する. _suru_ verbs are usually taught as their own class of verbs in JFL
education, and are trivial to conjugate.

As a general rule, as languages go rarely anything is ever "thrown away",
neither vocabulary nor grammar. Things change slowly and words might fall out
of fashion, but when we think about fundamental verbs of a language, we can
easily surmise that they won't be gone _that_ easily. Even 侍り (haberi) is
still here, despite being seldomly used, and written as 侍る (haberu), with the
kana spelling being more frequent.

We will now go back to our _regular_ conjugation classes, and roughly show how
they are conjugated, and then return to the _irregular_ classes to show with a
few examples how their conjugation looks like.

As opposed to godan, yodan conjugates using only four vowels out of the gojūon
table. The four vowels are _a_, _i_, _u_, _e_, _e_. To illustrate this with a
verb, we will choose our trusty 書く (kaku) again.

|             | 書く (kaku)         | Yodan Vowel |
| :---------- | :------------------ | :---------- |
| Negative    | 書かず (kakazu)    | あ          |
| Infinitive  | 書きます (kakimasu) | い          |
| Dictionary  | 書く (kaku)     | う          |
| Imperative  | 書け (kake)     | え          |
| Conditional | 書けば (kakeba) | え          |
| Volitional  |  (tabeyō)   | え          |

# Resources

Sites that were incredibly useful with my research were

- [古典文法 (Kotenbunpō)](https://www.kotenbunpou.com/) this seems to be
  popular with students who will 10 years later moan when anyone in their
  vicinity mentions the word "Kotenbunpō" and convey you their disdain for that
  particular class in secondary school.
- Anything in Wiktionary on Japanese conjugation, like this article on
  [quadrigrade conjugation](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%E5%9B%9B%E6%AE%B5%E6%B4%BB%E7%94%A8#Japanese). Whoever took the time to write this, thank you. Same applies to the Japanese versions of the articles.

# Appendix

As a side note, the least helpful was the Japanese Wikipedia on Japanese
grammar, since it used some questionable phrasings on the exact nature of who
is [learning the grammar](https://ja.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=%E4%B8%8A%E4%B8%80%E6%AE%B5%E6%B4%BB%E7%94%A8&oldid=76809213):

> 外国人を対象にした日本語教育においては下一段活用とともに｢グループ2｣と呼ばれる。

Which translates to

> Japanese language education targeted at __foreigners__ calls it together with
> lower monograde conjugation "Group 2"

To which I have to say:

1. None of the text books I have used ever mentioned Group 2 and usually say
   ichidan, godan, suru/kuru.
2. Putting the word "foreigner" in a sentence about grammar is immediately
   _yuck_. What do arbitrarily drawn geopolitical borders have to do with
   the empirically observable nature of a language?
3. So if you learn Japanese as a Japanese citizen as an adult (perhaps because
   you grew up abroad), would you still call it Group 2?

Maybe it's just an innocent phrase that accidentally found its way into a
Wikipedia article (and basically every other article about conjugation grades,
I haven't gotten around to correcting all of them). And no one was bothered by
it for the decade or so it was standing there. But Japanese Wikipedia could
sure use a dose of "This article only describes the situation in Japan, please
find more examples from other countries".

Using Japanese Wikipedia for research made me realize that as opposed to the
English Wikipedia, there is a big risk for a serious monoculture. When a
collectively authored encyclopedia is only accessible to a small percentage of
the world's population, and is able to "set in stone" knowledge, it concerns me
a little bit. On the bright side, more and more people learn Japanese, so maybe
this can change!
